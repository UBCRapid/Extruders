% what are betas?
%if resistance and inductance don't change much over the range of temperatures, then we can represent them by a linear function
%beta is the slope
% R(T) = R0(T0) + betaR*(T-T0)
% L(T) = L0(T0) + betaL*(T-T0)
% one way to calculate the betas is to take the slope about T0
% Another way is to calculate the average slope of the entire function by dividing the range by the domain
% Which method is the best approximation depends on which temperature is chosen to be T0
%Note, this method assumes a linspaced T.
