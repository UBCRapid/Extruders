% UBC Rapid Induction Heater Project File
%Calculates the temperature distribution in a glass extruder, using a one-dimensional model with heat conduction and plastic flow
%
%T_y is the temperature as a function of the distance y from the heater plate (K)
%flow is the volume flow rate in the extruder (m^3/s)
%P_in is the input heating power (W)
%
%C_plastic is the specific heat capacity of the plastic (J/kgK)
%
%dens_plastic is the density of the plastic (kg/m^3)
%r_plastic is the radius of plastic filament (m)
%r_glass is the outer radius of the extruder barrel (m)
%k_plastic is the thermal conductivity of the plastic (W/mK)
%k_glass is the thermal conductivity of the glass (W/mK)
%L_glass is the length of the glass barrel, or the distance to the heat sink (m)
%numpts is the number of locations at which to calculate the temperature between 0 and L_glass
%T_env is the atmospheric temperature (Celsius)
%P_in is the input heating power (W), put -1 if unknown
%T_melt is the maximum temperature achieved in the extruder (K), put -1 if unknown
%flow is the volume flow rate in the extruder (m^3/s), put -1 or leave blank if unknown
%
%two of P_in, T_melt, or flow must be specified. The third will be calculated based on the other two.
